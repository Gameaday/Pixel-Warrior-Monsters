# Pixel Warrior Monsters - Incomplete Features Report

## Summary
This report details the incomplete, stubbed, and missing features found during validation of the Pixel Warrior Monsters game implementation.

## Build System Issues ❌ CRITICAL
- **Gradle Compatibility**: Build fails due to Gradle version incompatibility
- **Dependencies**: Some dependencies may use deprecated Gradle APIs
- **Testing**: Cannot run the 119+ unit tests due to build failures
- **Linting**: No code quality tools (ktlint, detekt) configured

## Phase 6: Quality of Life & Polish ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

### Implemented Features ✅
- **Achievement System**: Fully implemented with 15+ achievements
- **Statistics Tracking**: Complete with automatic triggers
- **Advanced AI**: 12 personality types with difficulty scaling
- **Animation System**: Data structures and settings framework

### Missing/Incomplete Features ❌
- **Audio Files**: No actual 8-bit audio assets exist
  - All music, voice acting, and monster cries are simulated via `delay()`
  - Missing 30+ audio files (music tracks, voice lines, monster cries, SFX)
- **Real Audio Engine**: Current implementation is delay-based simulation
  - Needs actual AudioTrack/MediaPlayer integration
  - Requires 8-bit waveform synthesis (square, triangle, sawtooth, etc.)

## Phase 7: Cross-Platform Features ❌ STUB ONLY

### What Exists
- Basic `CrossPlatformSystem` class with method signatures
- Data classes for friends, mods, leaderboards
- Enum definitions for various states

### What's Missing (Everything)
- **Steam Integration**: No Steam SDK integration
- **Cloud Saves**: No cloud storage implementation (Google Play Games, Steam Cloud)
- **Mod Support**: No mod loading, validation, or execution system
- **Social Features**: No friend system, trading, or leaderboards
- **Desktop Adaptation**: No enhanced graphics or keyboard support

## Data Persistence Issues ⚠️

### Found TODOs
1. `GameRepository.kt:58` - TODO: Persist to local storage/database
2. `GameRepository.kt:69` - TODO: Load from local storage/database
3. `BattleEngine.kt:148` - TODO: Load skill from skill database
4. `BattleEngine.kt:163` - TODO: Implement defense boost for next turn
5. `WorldExplorer.kt:81` - TODO: Use actual player level
6. `SaveLoadScreen.kt:117` - TODO: Implement save deletion
7. `MainGameScreen.kt:176` - TODO: Handle monster selection

## Audio System Analysis

### Current Implementation
- **ChiptuneAudioEngine**: Simulates audio with coroutine delays
- **Voice System**: Returns voice IDs but no actual audio files
- **Monster Cries**: Sound ID generation without audio assets
- **Music Tracks**: Procedural note sequences using delays

### Required for Production
- Create/obtain 8-bit audio assets:
  - 6+ music tracks (title, world, battle, breeding, victory, boss)
  - 8+ monster cry audio files (one per monster type)
  - 10+ voice acting clips (synthetic 8-bit character voices)
  - 6+ sound effects (menu, battle, level up, capture)
- Implement real audio synthesis or file playback
- Add audio compression and streaming support

## Testing Status
- **Total Test Files**: 10 test classes found
- **Estimated Test Methods**: 119 unit tests
- **Test Coverage**: Cannot verify due to build issues
- **Integration Tests**: Unknown status

## Recommended Priority Order

1. **CRITICAL**: Fix Gradle build system to enable development
2. **HIGH**: Implement real audio system with actual files
3. **HIGH**: Complete data persistence implementation
4. **MEDIUM**: Implement Phase 7 cross-platform features
5. **LOW**: Add code quality tools (linting, static analysis)

## Launch Readiness Assessment

### Ready for Launch ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED
**Blocking Issues:**
- Cannot build/compile the project
- No actual audio assets (major gameplay impact)
- Data persistence is incomplete
- Phase 7 features are marketing promises but not implemented

### Estimated Work Required
- **Build System**: 1-2 days
- **Audio Implementation**: 1-2 weeks (including asset creation)
- **Data Persistence**: 3-5 days
- **Phase 7 Features**: 4-8 weeks (significant development)
- **Quality Assurance**: 1-2 weeks

**Total Estimated Time to Launch-Ready**: 2-3 months of development
