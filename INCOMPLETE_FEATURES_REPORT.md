  - All music, voice acting, and monster cries are simulated via `delay()`
  - Missing 30+ audio files (music tracks, voice lines, monster cries, SFX)
- **Real Audio Engine**: Current implementation is delay-based simulation
  - Needs actual AudioTrack/MediaPlayer integration
  - Requires 8-bit waveform synthesis (square, triangle, sawtooth, etc.)

## Phase 7: Cross-Platform Features ❌ STUB ONLY

### What Exists
- Basic `CrossPlatformSystem` class with method signatures
- Data classes for friends, mods, leaderboards
- Enum definitions for various states

### What's Missing (Everything)
- **Steam Integration**: No Steam SDK integration
- **Cloud Saves**: No cloud storage implementation (Google Play Games, Steam Cloud)
- **Mod Support**: No mod loading, validation, or execution system
- **Social Features**: No friend system, trading, or leaderboards
- **Desktop Adaptation**: No enhanced graphics or keyboard support

## Data Persistence Issues ❌ CRITICAL

### Found TODOs Indicating Incomplete Core Features
1. `GameRepository.kt:58` - TODO: Persist to local storage/database
2. `GameRepository.kt:69` - TODO: Load from local storage/database  
3. `BattleEngine.kt:148` - TODO: Load skill from skill database
4. `BattleEngine.kt:163` - TODO: Implement defense boost for next turn
5. `WorldExplorer.kt:81` - TODO: Use actual player level
6. `SaveLoadScreen.kt:117` - TODO: Implement save deletion
7. `MainGameScreen.kt:176` - TODO: Handle monster selection

### Additional Missing Core Systems
8. **Story Quest System**: No quest data structures or progression tracking
9. **Skill Database**: Skills are hardcoded, no database system
10. **Item Usage System**: Items defined but no usage mechanics
11. **Monster Deployment**: Scout system framework only
12. **Synthesis Process**: Synthesis lab screen exists but no actual synthesis implementation

## Audio System Analysis

### Current Implementation
- **ChiptuneAudioEngine**: Simulates audio with coroutine delays
- **Voice System**: Returns voice IDs but no actual audio files
- **Monster Cries**: Sound ID generation without audio assets
- **Music Tracks**: Procedural note sequences using delays

### Required for Production
- Create/obtain 8-bit audio assets:
  - 6+ music tracks (title, world, battle, breeding, victory, boss)
  - 8+ monster cry audio files (one per monster type)
  - 10+ voice acting clips (synthetic 8-bit character voices)
  - 6+ sound effects (menu, battle, level up, capture)
- Implement real audio synthesis or file playback
- Add audio compression and streaming support

## Testing Status
- **Total Test Files**: 10 test classes found
- **Estimated Test Methods**: 119 unit tests
- **Test Coverage**: Cannot verify due to build issues
- **Integration Tests**: Unknown status

## Launch Readiness Assessment

### Ready for Launch ❌ DEFINITELY NOT READY - MAJOR ISSUES FOUND
**Critical Blocking Issues:**
1. Cannot build/compile the project
2. No actual audio assets (major gameplay impact)
3. **Online Multiplayer Missing**: Phase 3 claims PvP implementation but it's completely absent
4. **Story System Missing**: No actual quest or story progression mechanics  
5. **Core Game Mechanics Incomplete**: Save/load, skill systems, synthesis process are stubs
6. Phase 7 features are marketing promises but not implemented

### Estimated Work Required (SIGNIFICANTLY REVISED)
- **Build System**: 1-2 days
- **Audio Implementation**: 1-2 weeks (including asset creation)
- **Data Persistence & Core Systems**: 2-3 weeks (save/load, skill database, item usage)
- **Story & Quest System**: 3-4 weeks (complete narrative framework)  
- **Online Multiplayer Implementation**: 6-8 weeks (networking, matchmaking, PvP battles)
- **Phase 7 Features**: 4-8 weeks (significant development)
- **Quality Assurance**: 2-3 weeks

**Total Estimated Time to Launch-Ready**: 4-6 months of development

## CORRECTED PHASE STATUS SUMMARY

- **Phase 1**: ⚠️ Hub system exists, story/quest system missing
- **Phase 2**: ⚠️ Monster systems partially implemented, key features missing  
- **Phase 3**: ❌ **MISSING ONLINE MULTIPLAYER** - major roadmap claim is false
- **Phase 4**: ✅ Mostly complete (exploration systems working)
- **Phase 5**: ✅ Mostly complete (endgame content framework exists)  
- **Phase 6**: ⚠️ Partially complete (audio system simulated only)
- **Phase 7**: ❌ Stub implementations only

**CONCLUSION**: The initial assessment was significantly incorrect. Critical gameplay features including online multiplayer, story progression, and core game mechanics are missing or incomplete. The project requires substantial additional development before being launch-ready.

### Ready for Launch ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED
**Blocking Issues:**
- Cannot build/compile the project
- No actual audio assets (major gameplay impact)
- Data persistence is incomplete
- Phase 7 features are marketing promises but not implemented

### Estimated Work Required
- **Build System**: 1-2 days
- **Audio Implementation**: 1-2 weeks (including asset creation)
- **Data Persistence**: 3-5 days
- **Phase 7 Features**: 4-8 weeks (significant development)
- **Quality Assurance**: 1-2 weeks

**Total Estimated Time to Launch-Ready**: 2-3 months of development
