# Production Bundle Preparation - Google Play Store

This document describes how to prepare the production bundle for Google Play Store submission.

## Overview

The production bundle includes:
1. **Android App Bundle (AAB)** - Primary format for Play Store
2. **Release APK** - For sideloading and testing
3. **Store Assets** - Icons, screenshots, graphics
4. **Compliance Documents** - Privacy policy, content rating
5. **Metadata** - App description, keywords, release notes

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Ready for Production
- Build system configured for release builds
- ProGuard/R8 optimization enabled
- Debug symbols preserved for crash reporting
- AAB and APK generation working
- CI/CD pipeline for automated builds

### ‚è≥ Pending Configuration
- Release keystore generation
- Play Console service account
- Store assets creation
- Privacy policy drafting
- Content rating questionnaire

## Building Production Bundle

### Prerequisites

1. **Release Keystore**
   ```bash
   # Generate a new keystore (only once)
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore release-key.jks \
     -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
     -alias pixelwarrior-key
   ```

2. **Keystore Configuration**
   Create `keystore.properties` in project root:
   ```properties
   storeFile=/path/to/release-key.jks
   storePassword=YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD
   keyAlias=pixelwarrior-key
   keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
   ```

3. **Update build.gradle**
   Add signing configuration (already configured, just needs keystore):
   ```gradle
   android {
       signingConfigs {
           release {
               if (project.file('keystore.properties').exists()) {
                   // Load keystore
                   def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("keystore.properties")
                   def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
                   keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
                   
                   storeFile file(keystoreProperties['storeFile'])
                   storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
                   keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
                   keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### Building Release Bundle

**Using build script:**
```bash
./build.sh release
```

**Manual build:**
```bash
./gradlew clean bundleRelease assembleRelease
```

**Output files:**
- AAB: `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
- APK: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### Automated Release via GitHub Actions

Push a version tag to trigger automated release:
```bash
# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This automatically:
1. Runs all tests
2. Performs security scans
3. Builds signed AAB and APK
4. Creates GitHub Release with artifacts
5. (Future) Uploads to Play Console
