### Phase 3: Store Assets & Compliance (TODO)
- [ ] Create high-resolution app icon (512x512px)
- [ ] Generate feature graphic and screenshots for all screen sizes
- [ ] Write store listing (title, description, keywords)
- [ ] Create privacy policy for data collection/usage
- [ ] Complete content rating questionnaire

### Phase 4: Play Console Setup (TODO)
- [ ] Create Google Play Console account

- [ ] Set up internal testing track for validation
- [ ] Configure release notes and rollout settings

### Phase 5: Launch Process (FUTURE)
- [ ] Internal testing release (validate signed build)
- [ ] Closed testing with limited users
- [ ] Open testing (beta) for broader feedback
- [ ] Production release when ready

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA
